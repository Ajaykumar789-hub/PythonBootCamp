###In insertion sort first round not required
## Remember Card game, before we place small number beween two numbers we will change position of greater card

## 12, 25, 11, 34, 90, 22
#Round1: 12   --->only one card given to us at this time in card round
##Round2: 12 25 ---> 25 is less than 12 so it at right place
##Round3: *11, 12, 25 --> 3rd card(current card) is 11 we fist check with round3-1 card fist and check and then after that card
